- ⏲️ Prep time: 30 min
- 🍳 Cook time: 2 hours
- 🍽️ Servings: 2

## Ingredients

### For the Broth
1 Cornish hen
¼ cup uncooked rice
4 garlic cloves
3-inch piece of ginger
½ onion
3-4 green onion whites (reserve green tops for garnish)
3-5 tbsp fish sauce
3-4 rock sugar cubes (or 1-2 tbsp granulated sugar)
Salt, to taste

### Spice Packet
2 tsp fennel seeds
2 tsp coriander seeds
3-4 whole cloves
3-4 star anise

### For Serving
Fresh cilantro, chopped
Green onions, sliced
 White or red onion, thinly sliced
Lime wedges
Rice noodles

### Shallot Oil
2-3 shallots, thinly sliced
½ cup olive oil or avocado oil
Salt, to taste


## Directions
1. **Parboil the hen**: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the Cornish hen and boil for 2-3 minutes to remove impurities. Drain and rinse the hen and pot.
2. **Stuff the hen**: Fill the cavity with ¼ cup uncooked rice and 4 garlic cloves.
3. **Simmer**: Return the stuffed hen to the clean pot. Add water until it just barely covers the hen (it's fine if some parts are exposed—steam will cook it). Bring to a gentle simmer.
4. **Char aromatics**: While the hen simmers, char the ginger and onion directly over a gas flame or under the broiler until blackened in spots. This adds depth to the broth.
5. **Add aromatics**: Add the charred ginger, charred onion, and green onion whites to the pot. Simmer on low heat for 1 hour.
6. **Season**: After 1 hour, add 3-5 tbsp fish sauce and 3-4 rock sugar cubes. Add the spice packet (fennel, coriander, cloves, and star anise—tied in cheesecloth or added loose). Simmer for another 30 minutes. Pho spices can be toasted lightly in a dry pan before adding to deepen their flavor.
7. **Adjust seasoning**: Taste and adjust with more fish sauce, sugar, or salt as needed.
### Make the Shallot Oil
1. **Fry shallots**: Heat ½ cup oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add thinly sliced shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Remove from heat just before they burn.
2. **Strain**: Strain the fried shallots from the oil. Reserve both separately. Season the oil with a pinch of salt.
### Serve
1. Cook rice noodles according to package directions.
2. Remove the Cornish hen from the broth and carve into pieces.
3. Arrange noodles in bowls, top with hen pieces, and ladle hot broth over everything.
4. Garnish with chopped cilantro, sliced green onions, thinly sliced raw onion, fried shallots, and a squeeze of lime.
5. Serve the seasoned shallot oil on the side for dipping the chicken
